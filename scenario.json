You have been placed on a floating island high above the Earth, safe but isolated. Only by using the reality-bending powers of warp technology can you visit the world below in brief, randomly-targeted excursions. Venture down, gather supplies, and return with only what you can carry to upgrade your home base and your stash over time.",
